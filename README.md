# 100 Days of Trump

*100 Days of Trump* is a project designed to collect articles from the first 100 days of the Trump Presidency into a CSV file. From there, the CSV file can be turned into a Timeline through TimelineJS. The goal of this project is to be able to compare and contrast coverage of the Trump Presidency's first 100 days across different media outlets.

The project collects articles from the New York Times and Brietbart. There are no plans on continuing the project.
